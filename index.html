        <h3>Work Bio</h3>
        <div class="work">
          <p>I am currently working at <strong>Airbnb</strong> as a Customer Experience Specialist. Prior to Airbnb, I spent 14 years working in Emergency Medicine as an Emergency Department Technician. Now that I have tasted the <em>sweet, juicy nectar</em> of tech, I want to expand my horizons and learn how to code.  I dream of one day working as a Product Designer, or perhaps as a Junior Developer.</p>

        <h3>Personal Bio</h3>
        <div class="personal">
          <p>In my free time, I am an avid outdoorswoman and traveler. I have walked the <span style="color:yellow;font-weight:bold">Camino de Santiago</span> in Spain twice. I enjoy hiking short, long trails like the Timberline Trail, the West Coast Trail and the Wonderland Trail. I have traveled extensively throughout Europe, the Middle East and Asia. I delivered humanitarian aid to Nepal after the earthquake in May 2015. I am constantly working to be the best version of myself and welcome fearless feedback on how I can improve as a human being.  Life is a journey and I am taking full advantage of all it has to offer.</p>
